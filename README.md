# vectara-sdk
A Python SDK for Vectara written by the field to help you add GenerativeAI to your applications
without needing to hire a Data Scientist. It helps you work with a Corpus and add documents
to your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Getting Started
Testing this out now - TBD

## Get Help
This is in no way a supported part of the Vectara stack though
depending on goodwill between client and the account team, we'll look into issues on your behalf
without strict SLA's. Offers of coffee may help accelerate this, or if virtual, some pleasant
conversation:-)

## TODOs
List of todos
* Switch PDF to Amin's useQA paper and "Attention is all you need" paper.
