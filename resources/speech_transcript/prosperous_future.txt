Every smartphone ships today with a standard 4K camera, four core CPU and GPU, a machine learning engine and a neural engine. These capabilities will help us tackle things like type two diabetes, where it's one of the leading causes of blindness, and it's going to empower everybody to. To reach out to their smartphone, take a photo of their retina, and be able to have early detection of signs of type two diabetes. So the convolution of big data, AI and artificial intelligence is going to disrupt everything that we know it today if we move on to safeguarding the planet. And when it comes to safeguarding the planet, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia today is the global leader in thermal energy.

And we have leveraged connectivity, big data and AI to deliver one of the safest and cleanest upstream activities in Aramco. And if we fast forward into our responsibility to move from thermal energy into green and sustainable and renewable energy, with the future city of Neom, we are able to bring down the economics of green photons to green electrons, to green hydrogen to such a feasible level that will empower us to energize things that cannot be powered by the grid today, which is really 60% of the energy mix that we have today. And Neom is one of the top three destinations in terms of our ability to convert wind and solar into green electrons with an electrolysis process. With the Red Sea. To deliver green energy at such an affordable rate, it will help us fast forward green aviation and green maritime transportation, because these things, until today, cannot be powered by a lithium battery.
